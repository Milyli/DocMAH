# DocMAH - Documentation Module and Handler
DocMAH is a library that easily integrates with any .NET web 
application to provide a full service help and documentation system.

_More information available at http://docmah.net... eventually._

## Goals
In the spirit of <a href="https://code.google.com/p/elmah/">ELMAH</a>, though not affiliated in any way that we know of, 
we set out to create a library easy to integrate with any .NET web application that provides a full service 
help and documentation system.

## Get DocMAH
DocMAH is available via <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/DocMAH" >NuGet</a>.
Or if you like, download or fork us here on GitHub.

## Features
* Deploy via NuGet.
* Drop the library in your bin, set your connection string, and start using.
* Automatic help database schema setup and versioning.
* First time help popups with user controls to hide and disable.
* Full documentation pages with table of contents.
* Editing tools baked into your application that require local access by default, and may optionally require authentication or be completely disabled for production environments.
* Generate a deployment script for help content with a button press. Deploy the file with your site to automatically update your help.
* Override the CSS and JavaScript to create your own look and feel.

## Recent Updates
* Overhaul of codebase to make it easier to test.
* Better tested code in order to safely make upcoming usability changes.

## On the Way
* On the heels of the code refactor and testing, we're going to be making some big usability improvements.
