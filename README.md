DocMAH is a library that easily integrates with any .NET web 
application to provide a full service help and documentation system.

## Goals
In the spirit of <a href="https://code.google.com/p/elmah/">ELMAH</a>, though not affiliated in any way that we know of, 
we set out to create a library easy to integrate with any .NET web application that provides a full service 
help and documentation system.

## Get DocMAH

* First time help popups with user controls to hide and disable.
* Full documentation pages with table of contents.
* Editing tools baked into your application that require local access by default, and may optionally require authentication or be completely disabled for production environments.
