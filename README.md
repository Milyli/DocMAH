## Goals
In the spirit of ELMAH (https://code.google.com/p/elmah/), though not affiliated in any way that we know of, 
we set out to create a library easy to integrate with any .NET web application that provides a full service 
help and documentation system.

## Features
* Drop the library in your bin, make some simple web.config additions and start using.
* Automatic help database schema setup and versioning.
* First time help popups with user controls to hide and disable.
* Full, CHM-like documentation pages.
* Editing tools baked into your application that optionally require local access and/or authentication, and may be disabled for production environments.
* Script help content with a button press to generate a deployment file. Deploy the file with your site to automatically update your help.
* Override the CSS and JavaScript to create your own look and feel.

## On the Way
* NuGet Package.
* More customization.
* More ease of use.
* More of everything!!!! MOAR!!!!!
* ... except bugs. Not more of those. Fewer bugs! FUEUER!!!!! (hopefully)
